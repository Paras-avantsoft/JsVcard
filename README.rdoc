= jsvCard - JavaScript vCard reader and parser

The main goal of this library is to make the boring personal data forms filling easier using your own vCard.

To accomplish this a parsing library has been developed from scratch and, taking advantage of HTML5 & JavaScript(nodeJs) it is possible to read the vCard directly from filesystem.

Here with use of nodeJs you can import your vcf file and get data in json format and also export your VCF file with the input in json format
