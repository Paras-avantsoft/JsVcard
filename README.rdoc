= jsvCard - JavaScript vCard reader and parser

The main goal of this library is to make the boring personal data forms filling easier using your own vCard.

To accomplish this a parsing library has been developed from scratch and, taking advantage of HTML5 & JavaScript it is possible to read the vCard directly from filesystem.
